How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensuring that my code is functional and secure involves me having a complete understanding and familiarity with the requirements and the industry standard practices.  The requirements of the project outlines what is needed, how it should behave, how the users intend on utilizing, etc.  Incorporating these elements into the program ensures that we provide a value, functional final deliverable that meets the needs and purpose of the project.  Abiding by and incorporating the indsutry standard practices, whether that involves implement specific cryptographic methods, secure coding practices, data structures, error handling and input validations, ensures that the users, the data and stakeholders can rest easy know that its protected to the best of our ability and knowledge.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs through the perspective of must-haves and nice-to-haves.  Meeting the overall requirements of the project is most important, but also listening to concerns and feedback from the users helps me understand user interface concerns and user experience pain points.  Creating a system that is accurate, easy to understand and enjoyable makes for a meaningful interaction and invites the users to continue to utilize the system.


How do I approach designing software?

I design software methodically and from various perspectives.  Designing software in units, breaks the project down into digestable pieces of tasks, making the overall job of completely the project in its entirety less stressful.  Considering how the software will behave and be used involves me considering it from various perspective, like stakeholders, clients and users.  Stakeholders want the project to be a success and deliver what was agreed upon.  Clients want what they need and what will be useful for them.  Users want something to help them accomplish a task, in an easy to understand and use manner.  Designing software with these considerations increases the odds of completing the project successfully.
